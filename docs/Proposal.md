## Background

Wildfires and crop failures pose substantial risks to lives, livelihoods, ecosystems, and national food security. For **wildfires**, utilities, insurers, and emergency managers need **risk maps** to prioritize vegetation management, pre-stage resources, and price risk. For **agriculture**, growers, agribusinesses, and governments need **near–real-time crop health monitoring** to manage inputs, hedge production risk, and mitigate food insecurity.

An **AI-driven geospatial platform** can transform raw satellite data into operational insights at regional to national scale. This project builds such a platform, combining **remote sensing**, **time-series ML**, and a **web application** to deliver wildfire risk layers, burned area maps, crop stress maps, and yield proxies.

---

## Project Objective

This capstone aims to design, implement, and evaluate an **end-to-end geospatial ML platform** that:

1. **Wildfire Segmentation (Post-Event):** Detects burned areas using Sentinel‑2 imagery, validated against MODIS Burned Area labels.  
2. **Wildfire Risk (Pre-Event):** Produces short-horizon risk scores by fusing vegetation/water indices, topography, and fire history.  
3. **Crop Monitoring:** Classifies crop vs. non‑crop (and optionally crop types) and flags **crop stress** using vegetation indices and temporal features.  
4. **Web Delivery:** Serves these layers through a **Next.js + FastAPI** web platform where users draw an AOI and receive map overlays and summary analytics.

---

## Why it Matters

- **Farmers & AgTech:** Field-level stress alerts and yield proxies improve planning and reduce losses.  
- **Insurers & Reinsurers:** Better pricing and portfolio management for wildfire and crop insurance.  
- **Utilities & Public Safety:** Targeted vegetation management and early wildfire warnings can prevent catastrophic events.  
- **Government & NGOs:** Food-security monitoring, disaster response prioritization, and climate‑resilience planning.

## Research Questions

1. **Wildfire (Post-Event):** Can a segmentation model trained on Sentinel‑2 predict burned areas that align with MODIS MCD64A1 labels (IoU ≥ baseline)?  
2. **Wildfire (Pre-Event):** Which features (NDVI, NDWI, slope, prior burns, weather proxies) most strongly predict next‑week fire risk?  
3. **Crops:** Can crop/stress classification achieve robust accuracy across regions and seasons?  
4. **Generalization:** How well do models trained in one region transfer to different biomes (cross‑region mIoU/F1)?  
5. **Latency:** Can the pipeline deliver AOI analytics in near real time for practical decision‑making?

## Data

### Primary Data Sources (Public/Open)
- **Sentinel‑2 Surface Reflectance (10 m, multispectral)** — input imagery (RGB, NIR, red‑edge): Copernicus Open Access / Google Earth Engine (GEE).  
- **MODIS Burned Area (MCD64A1, 500 m, monthly)** — ground truth for burned area segmentation; available on GEE.  
- **NASA FIRMS (MODIS/VIIRS active fire points)** — near real‑time fire detections for feature engineering and validation.  
- **USDA Cropland Data Layer (CDL, 30 m, annual, USA)** — crop type labels and agricultural mask; available on GEE.  
- **SRTM DEM (30 m)** — elevation-derived **slope**/aspect for fire spread risk.  
- **(Optional) Weather/Reanalysis** — e.g., ERA5 temperature, humidity, wind for risk features.

### Local Copies
The repo will maintain **scripts** to export curated **AOI mosaics and masks** into `data/raw/` and model‑ready tiles into `data/dataset/`. Large rasters will not be versioned; instead, **reproducible ETL** will be provided.

## Data Overview & Dictionary (Model-Ready Tiles)

We will create 512×512 **image tiles** (10 m Sentinel‑2 grid) and aligned **mask tiles** for two tasks: **wildfire segmentation** and **crop segmentation**.

| Field | Type | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tile_id` | string | Unique tile identifier (`y{row}_x{col}`) | `y10240_x2560` |
| `aoi_name` | string | AOI tag for stratified splits | `Sonoma_CA` |
| `acq_date` | date | Mosaic acquisition window mid-date | `2021-08-01` |
| `img_rgbn` | 3–4ch PNG | Sentinel‑2 RGB(+NIR) tile, normalized to [0,1] | `images/y10240_x2560.png` |
| `ndvi` / `ndwi` / `nbr` | float32 rasters | Vegetation & water indices (derived) | stored or recomputed |
| `slope` | float32 raster | From SRTM (reprojected to S2 grid) | optional |
| `burned_mask` | uint8 PNG | 0/1 mask from MODIS MCD64A1 reprojected to S2 grid | `wildfire/masks/*.png` |
| `crop_mask` | uint8 PNG | Crop vs. non‑crop or mapped CDL classes | `crop/masks/*.png` |
| `region_split` | {train,val,test} | Stratified split by region/city | `train` |

> **Targets:**  
> • **Wildfire Segmentation:** `burned_mask ∈ {0,1}`.  
> • **Crop Segmentation:** `crop_mask ∈ {0,…,K}` (start with binary crop vs. non‑crop; optionally map CDL classes to a small K).

## Features

- **Spectral:** RGB, NIR, red‑edge; indices: **NDVI**, **NDWI**, **NBR** (if SWIR is added).  
- **Topographic:** **Slope** (from DEM).  
- **Temporal:** Rolling composites (e.g., median of last N weeks), lags, and trend deltas for risk/yield proxies.  
- **Contextual:** Prior burned area, distance to roads/settlements (optional).  
- **Meteorology (optional):** ERA5 temperature, wind, humidity (aggregated to tile).

## Methods

1. **ETL & Tiling**  
   - GEE scripts produce AOI mosaics and masks.  
   - Python (rasterio/rioxarray) aligns all rasters to **S2 10 m grid** and generates tiles.

2. **Modeling**  
   - **Wildfire Segmentation:** U‑Net/DeepLabV3+ trained on Sentinel‑2 → target = burned mask (binary).  
   - **Wildfire Risk (Classification/Regression):** Gradient boosting or CNN‑LSTM/Transformer over temporal features to predict short‑horizon risk score or probability of burn.  
   - **Crop Segmentation:** U‑Net/SegFormer; start binary (crop vs. non‑crop), then expand to multi‑class (selected CDL codes).

3. **Evaluation**  
   - **Segmentation:** mIoU, F1, precision/recall.  
   - **Risk:** AUROC/AUPRC (classification) or RMSE/MAE (regression).  
   - **Generalization:** Train on Region A, test on Region B (holdout cities/biomes).  
   - **Latency:** AOI‑to‑result time on the web platform.

4. **Ablations**  
   - Bands only vs. bands + indices vs. + slope.  
   - With/without temporal aggregation.  
   - Binary crop vs. selected multi‑class mapping.  
   - Cross‑region transfer.

## Web Platform (System Architecture)

- **Frontend:** **Next.js** with a map viewport. Users **draw/upload AOI**, select a date window, and request layers.  
- **Backend API:** **FastAPI** exposes `/aoi/analyze` → orchestrates: fetch mosaics (cached), tile, **batch inference**, and compose overlays.  
- **Model Serving:** PyTorch models loaded once per worker; tiling/stitching pipeline returns GeoTIFF/PNG overlays + summaries.  
- **Storage:** AOI requests, metadata, and cached rasters in object storage (e.g., S3/GCS); analytics in **PostgreSQL/PostGIS**.  
- **Deployment:** Render/AWS/GCP; horizontal scale by AOI job queue.

---

## Baselines & Success Criteria

- **Wildfire Segmentation:** Exceed a simple threshold baseline (e.g., NDVI drop) and target **mIoU ≥ 0.55** on held‑out regions.  
- **Crop Segmentation:** Binary crop vs. non‑crop **F1 ≥ 0.85** on held‑out counties.  
- **Latency:** Return AOI results (≤ 50 km²) in **< 2 minutes** on a single GPU or optimized CPU node.  
- **Usability:** Web UI can accept AOI polygons and render results as overlays with a downloadable GeoTIFF/PNG.

---

## Timeline (12 Weeks)

- **W1–W2:** Literature review; AOI selection; GEE + ETL pipelines; first AOI tiles.  
- **W3–W5:** Train wildfire segmentation baseline; metrics + error analysis.  
- **W6–W7:** Train crop segmentation baseline (binary); evaluate + ablate features.  
- **W8–W9:** Add wildfire risk (temporal features/model); cross‑region tests.  
- **W10:** Build web platform MVP (AOI → overlays).

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Clouds/Haze:** Use QA masks & temporal compositing.  
- **Label Noise (MODIS/CDL):** Morphological cleaning, confidence thresholds, and selective AOI curation.  
- **Domain Shift:** Explicit cross‑region validation; fine‑tuning on small samples from new regions.  
- **Throughput:** Asynchronous job queue + caching; tile‑level batch inference; optional GPU serving.

---

## Ethics & Responsible AI

- Use only **open** satellite products and properly attribute sources.  
- Document data limitations (e.g., resolution gaps, label uncertainty).  
- Publish a **datasheet/model card** with intended use, failure modes, and fairness considerations (e.g., rural vs. urban performance).
